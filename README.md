# Sensor Fault Detection: Air Pressure System (APS) for Heavy-Duty Vehicles üöõüîß

**Sensor-Fault-Detection** is an advanced solution designed to improve the safety, reliability, and performance of heavy-duty vehicles by **accurately detecting and classifying failures** within the **Air Pressure System (APS)**. This system leverages **machine learning algorithms** and **real-time sensor data** to minimize false predictions, optimize repair decisions, and enhance vehicle safety and operational efficiency.

By providing accurate fault detection, our solution helps to prevent unnecessary repairs, reduce downtime, and ensure that the APS operates optimally, ensuring that heavy-duty vehicles remain on the road longer and safer.

## üåü Overview

The **Air Pressure System (APS)** is vital for the proper functioning of various components in heavy-duty vehicles, such as braking, suspension, and engine control. APS faults can lead to serious safety hazards, excessive repair costs, and system failures if not detected early.

Our solution focuses on developing a **robust fault detection system** that can accurately classify APS failures by analyzing sensor data from multiple APS components. By reducing false positives and accurately identifying the root cause of failures, we can significantly optimize repair decisions, minimize unnecessary repairs, and enhance the overall performance of the vehicle.

The problem is to reduce the cost due to unnecessary repairs. So it is required to minimize the false predictions.

Key benefits:
- **Minimized false predictions**: Reduces the likelihood of unnecessary maintenance.
- **Optimized repair decisions**: Helps identify critical issues early, prioritizing repairs that prevent failure.
- **Improved vehicle safety**: By detecting faults early, we can prevent safety risks associated with APS failures.
- **Enhanced operational efficiency**: Reduces downtime and repair costs, improving fleet operations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started, you‚Äôll need:

- Python 3.10 or later
- Docker (for deployment)
- MongoDB (for data storage)
- A virtual environment (optional, recommended)
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ankitvishwakarmaml/sensor-fault-detection.git
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up MongoDB:**

   Install and configure MongoDB, or use a cloud MongoDB service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas). Update the connection details in the `config.json` file.

5. **Set up Docker (for deployment):**

   - Build Docker images for the app:

     ```bash
     docker build -t sensor-fault-detection .
     ```

   - Run the container:

     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name sensor-fault-detection sensor-fault-detection
     ```

6. **Run the fault detection system:**

   After setting up the data source (either real-time sensor data or test datasets), run the fault detection script:

   ```bash
   python detect_faults.py
   ```

   This will start analyzing APS data and classifying potential failures.

### Optional: Set up a Dashboard

1. **Run the Flask web service:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the dashboard in your browser:**

   Visit `http://localhost:5000` to view the live monitoring dashboard, which shows sensor data, fault events, and system health.

## üîß Usage

- **Fault Detection & Classification:** 
  The system continuously analyzes APS sensor data and detects faults (e.g., pressure drops, leaks, sensor failures). Detected faults are classified, and alerts are generated accordingly.

- **Predictive Maintenance:** 
  Based on historical data, the system predicts future faults, allowing you to schedule maintenance before issues become critical.

- **Visualization:**
  The dashboard provides visualizations of sensor data, fault events, and system health over time. It allows for easy identification of patterns and trends in APS performance.

- **Scalable Deployment:** 
  The Dockerized solution ensures easy scaling to manage large fleets, with MongoDB serving as a scalable data storage backend.

- **Real-time Alerts:** 
  The system can send real-time alerts via email, SMS, or an integrated API when faults are detected, ensuring quick response times.
